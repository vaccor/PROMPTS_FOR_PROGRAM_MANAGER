# Prompt Engineering for Project/Program Managers

## Scope

This repository provides AI-driven prompts specifically designed for project and program managers to improve quality, velocity and efficiency in their daily working

## About This Repository

The approach of using GitHub as a repository proves to be a valid method for structuring technical documentation, resulting in improved productivity for the generation of scientific content.

## What You'll Learn
- How to implement effective prompts for various project management tasks
- Examples of AI-generated insights for risk assessment, contract and/or technical specification document analysis
- Best practices for integrating AI into project workflows

## Available Prompts
Prompts available are:
### Risk Assessment
Prompts are implemented using a keyword strategy: keywords from the domain being worked on are specified, narrowing the work area and the context within which the AI engine will retrieve information and generate the response. This approach is far more efficient than a generic request.
The document Prompts_Risks_Assessments contains following contents:
1) Risk Catalog. Contains Risk Category, Keywords and Risk Owner
2) Prompt: Contains the general template of Risk Management prompt
3) Example: Contains an example for the Risk Category CONTRACT
Follows the instruction
a) Fill out the prompt template following the instructions provided.
b) Copy the prompt to your personal "My Prompts" area by clicking to add a new prompt.
c) Save the prompt.
d) Run the prompt on any document.
e) Analyze the results.

### Contract and technical specification analysis
Several prompts have been implemented in the context of document analysis (contracts, scope of work, or technical-functional specifications). 
Each prompt is specific to the field of interest: purpose, terms & conditions, personal data, penalties, etc. 
In this context, too, the keyword strategy is used to better target the request.
The reference document is Prompt_Checking_Documents.
